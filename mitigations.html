        <li><strong>Never reuse a password</strong>; instead, use a password manager to create and maintain strong passwords.  Gawker and rootkit.com, both forums for computer techs, report a password reuse rate of between 31% and 43%. These types of websites attract a more technically savvy crowd, which know the risks of password re-use and would cause their  password reuse rates to be lower than typical users. This would mean that the average user has password re-usage rate that is likely much greater than might be found on those forums. </li>
        <li><strong>Never click unknown links</strong>, especially if you didn't go looking for that information.  Hackers will “spoof” a legitimate website, or create an imitation website in an effort to obtain usernames and passwords from unsuspecting users. </li>
        <li><strong>Only install from the original source</strong> (never download pirated or cracked software), and always install updates.  A user should not trust that other sources have not tampered with the original source code.  </li>
        <li>Users should <strong>limit the use of the Administrator account</strong> because any process that might try to run on the computer will be able to automatically execute with prompting the user for access.  </li>
        <li><strong>Keep</strong> system and application <strong>software up-to-date</strong> so that any known holes in software security are patched.  When a patch is released it draws attention to flaw in the software so hackers exploit this flaw on users who have not yet applied the patch.</li>
        <li><strong>Ensure that a device firewall is active</strong> as it will try to prevent malicious software from gaining access to the device.  Double check the settings within the system or security software occasionally to be sure the firewall is active.</li>
        <li><strong>Do not click</strong> on or follow directions of popup windows that tell you that your computer is infected with a virus as these windows are malicious advertisements masquerading as antivirus software.</li>
        <li><strong>Be careful with email attachments</strong>. Hackers will embed viruses or malware in files in the hopes that a user will download and open the file releasing the virus or malware into the system.</li>
