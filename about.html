  I am 29 years old, I work as a swimming instructor teaching children from 5 weeks to 15 years old how to swim. I love working with computers and helping family, friends and co-workers out with computer problems. Due to all the time i have spent fixing computers due to bugs and malware I have become extra aware of the issues around computers and security and now the security of these devices is something I find fascinating to observe. This Sites goal is to help others get a glimpse into the nuances of computers security and help them be safe when browsing online.
